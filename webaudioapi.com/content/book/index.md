Book
===

I wrote a short book about the Web Audio API called "Web Audio API: Advanced
Sound for Games and Interactive Apps".

> This book is what I wish existed when I started experimenting with the API in 2011. It is intended to be a springboard for web developers like I was, with little to no digital-audio expertise. It contains the things I learned from about a year of studying digital audio processing, having conversations with audio experts, and experimenting with the API.

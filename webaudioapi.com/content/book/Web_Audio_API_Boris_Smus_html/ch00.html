    <section xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="introduction" data-type="preface"><h1>Preface</h1><p>Thank you for picking up the first book on the topic of the Web Audio
  API. When I first learned of the Web Audio API, I was a complete
  digital-audio novice embarking on a journey to learn and understand the API,
  as well as the underlying fundamental audio concepts. This book is what I
  wish existed when I started experimenting with the API in 2011. It is
  intended to be a springboard for web developers like I was, with little to
  no digital-audio expertise. It contains the things I learned from about a
  year of studying digital audio processing, having conversations with audio
  experts, and experimenting with the API.</p><p>The theoretical bits will be filled in through asides, which will
  explain the concepts. If you are a digital-audio guru, feel free to skip
  these. The practical bits will be illustrated with code snippets to give you
  a better sense of how the API works in real life. Many of the examples also
  include links to working samples that can be found <a href="http://webaudioapi.com/samples">on this Web Audio API
  site</a>.</p><section id="s00_3" data-type="sect1"><h1>Structure of This Book</h1><p>This book aims to give a high-level overview of a number of
    important features of the Web Audio API, but is not an exhaustive survey
    of every available feature. It is not intended as a comprehensive guide,
    but as an easy starting point. Most sections of the book start off by
    describing an application, outlining the problem and solution, and then
    showing relevant sample JavaScript Web Audio API code. Interspersed theory
    sections explain some of the underlying audio concepts in more general
    terms. The book is structured in the following way:</p><ol><li><p><a href="ch01.html#ch01" data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title">Fundamentals</a> covers the
        basics of audio graphs, typical graph configurations, audio nodes
        inside those graphs, loading sound files, and playing sounds
        back.</p></li><li><p><a href="ch02.html#ch02" data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title">Perfect Timing and Latency</a> delves into
        precise scheduling of sound in the future, multiple simultaneous
        sounds, changing parameters directly or over time, and
        crossfading.</p></li><li><p><a href="ch03.html#ch03" data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title">Volume and Loudness</a> covers gain,
        volume, and loudness, as well as preventing clipping via metering and
        dynamics compression.</p></li><li><p><a href="ch04.html#ch04" data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title">Pitch and the Frequency Domain</a> is all about
        sound frequency, an important property of periodic sound. We’ll also
        talk about oscillators and examining sound in the frequency <span class="keep-together">domain</span>.</p></li><li><p><a href="ch05.html#ch05" data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title">Analysis and Visualization</a> builds on the
        earlier chapters to dive into more advanced topics, including biquad
        filters, simulating acoustic environments, and spatialized
        sounds.</p></li><li><p>In <a href="ch06.html#ch06" data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title">Advanced Topics</a>, we will
        take a break from synthesizing and manipulating sound, and analyze and
        visualize sound instead.</p></li><li><p><a href="ch07.html#ch07" data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title">Integrating with Other Technologies</a> talks about
        interfacing Web Audio API with other web APIs like WebRTC and the
        <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag.</p></li></ol><p>The source code of the book itself is released under the Creative

In general, if this
    book includes code examples, you may use the code in your programs and
    documentation. You do not need to contact us for permission unless you’re
    reproducing a significant portion of the code. For example, writing a
    program that uses several chunks of code from this book does not require
    permission. Selling or distributing a CD-ROM of examples from O’Reilly
    books does require permission. Answering a question by citing this book
    and quoting example code does not require permission. Incorporating a
    significant amount of example code from this book into your product’s
    documentation does require permission.</p><p>We appreciate, but do not require, attribution. An attribution

    mixing by any stretch. I am a software engineer and amateur musician with
    enough interest in digital audio to spend some time exploring the Web
    Audio API and wrapping my head around some of its important concepts. To
    write this book, I had to continually bug others with far more
    digital-audio experience than me. I’d like to thank them for answering my
    questions, providing technical reviews for this book, and encouraging me
    along the way.</p><p>Specifically, this book could not have been written without the
    generous mentorship of Chris Rogers, the primary author of the Web Audio
    specification and also its main WebKit/Chrome implementer. I owe many
    thanks to Chris Wilson, who gave an incredibly thorough technical review
    of this book’s content, and to Mark Goldstein, who spent a few late nights
    doing editorial passes. My thanks to Kevin Ennis for donating <a href="http://webaudioapi.com">webaudioapi.com</a> for hosting samples
    related to the book. Last but not least, I would have never written this
    book without the support and interest of a vibrant Web Audio API community
    on the Web.</p><p>Without further ado, let’s dive in!</p></section></section>

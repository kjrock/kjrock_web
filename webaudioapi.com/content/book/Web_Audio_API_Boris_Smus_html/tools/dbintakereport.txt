Notes from Tools
================
** Syntax highlighting: applied to 0 out of 49 code listings.

** This is a Realtime so I turned on code wrapping and suppressed 
the colophon in the oneoff.css.

** Please let Tools know ASAP if there are any other global problems 
for which we can help automate a fix.

** Notes from Kristen
=====================
TOOLS:
-Needs boilerplate added to preface (and BM)

[Fixed at intake.--TOOLS]

-Book is in one "content.xml" file, can we break it apart?

[Fixed at intake.--TOOLS]

-TOC looks pretty funky...chapters look normal, but level 1 headers 
are in a different font.

[Fixed at intake.--TOOLS]

-Level 1 headers throughout book look odd, come to mention it.

[Fixed at intake.--TOOLS]

-URLs and xrefs are rendering with an underline (maybe this guy is 
using his own oneoff.css?)

[Fixed at intake. AU had nested xrefs and ulinks inside <emphasis 
role="underline">, so I removed those.--TOOLS]

-Rename App 1 and 2 to A, B.

[Fixed at intake.--TOOLS]

PROD:
-Will need a strong proofread
-Fix casing on headers
-A few long code lines
-Some unanchored URLS in the book
-Reformat glossary as a variable list

ART:
-AU has already been in touch with Rebecca about the illustrations. 
Look to be a lot of drawings.

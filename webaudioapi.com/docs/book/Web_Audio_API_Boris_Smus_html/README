You are looking at a live production repository. The XML markup has been normalized for the particular flavor of DocBook that our toolchain needs.

Your production editor will be working on these files on a daily basis and will be notified every time you make a change. Please defer to your 
production editor about coordinating the entering of edits in your book. To facilitate transparent coordination of changes made to the files, 
please be sure to enter a descriptive log message with each commit you make. 

Please consult your production editor or write to toolsreq@oreilly.com before making any changes related to:
* Images or image file structure
* General XML file structure

Please do not work in any old checkouts you may have of the external repository (https://prod.oreilly.com/external/authors/books/ISBN/current/).
That repo is no longer in use.
